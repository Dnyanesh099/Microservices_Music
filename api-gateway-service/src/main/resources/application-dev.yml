# ==========================================
# This is Dummy Data for Dev server how it is worked okkk
#Routes do not change between local, dev, or prod. 
#We use lb://SERVICE-ID routing in API Gateway, which resolves service locations through Eureka Discovery Server.
#only the Eureka endpoint changes using profile-specific configurations (local/dev/prod), not the route definitions.
